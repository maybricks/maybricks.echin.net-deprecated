                                    <p class="subtitle">Clay Preparation</p>
                                    <p>The manufacturing of brick begins with the gathering of surface clays and shales from the quarry. Raw materials are transported to storage areas in preparation for crushing. The crusher breaks up the large chunks of clay or shale and passes it to conveyors heading for the grinders. The grinders or 'Muller Wheels' pulverize the material to a fine consistency. The pulverized material passes over a vibrating screen in which the fine material passes through to the next step and the coarse material is returned to the grinder to be reground</p>
                                    <p>Up to this point the material has been kept dry. Once screened, the material is sent to the pug mill where it will be tempered to make a homogeneous plastic mass ready for shaping in the required brick form. The pug mill consists of a chamber that houses one or two revolving shafts with blades rigidly attached, which thoroughly mix the material. Water is added to provide the proper plasticity and materials, such as manganese, are added to change the body color.</p>
                                    <p>Clay preparation methods may have to accommodate the physical characteristics of the raw material and special provision may have to be made to deal with certain impurities.<p>
                                    <p>Preparation consists of transforming the clay rock into plastic mouldable material by a process of grinding and mixing with water. A typical factory might have a Primary crusher, these are used to break down large lumps of rock to manageable size, which can then be fed to a Secondary crusher, for example Pan mill, where the clay is reduced in size further. Water can be added here or if it is a dry pan the clay is reduced to dust and water added later. Further crushing takes place through conveyor rollers reducing the clay particles to about 1-2mm.</p>

                                    <p class="subtitle">Brick Making – Extrusion</p>
                                    <p>The clay body is mixed to a fairly stiff texture and is then loaded into an extruder where a worm screw pushes it along a barrel into a vacuum chamber which compresses it through a taper and out through a die. The die is machined to a precise size and shape larger than the finished size of the brick, calculating how much the clay will shrink during the drying and firing process. The clay emerges as a continuous brick shaped column. Initially this is smooth but it can be modified by removing a thin sliver from the top and sides using a taught wire to produce a ‘wiredrag’ effect or by placing textured rollers over the column to create a rusticated. The clay column is then cut into single bricks and be loaded onto kiln cars.</p>
                                    <p>These extruded bricks are generally perforated and can be solid but cannot be frogged.</p>

                                    <p class="subtitle">Drying</p>
                                    <p>Before the bricks can be fired, as much moisture as possible must be removed or they will explode in the kilns. Drying involves the removal of water from the wet brick in such a way as to dry them out evenly from inside out. If the outer skin of the brick dries first it becomes impossible for the moisture inside to escape. In the kiln the extreme temperatures will force out this moisture and some cracking may occur. To prevent this happening the dryers are kept at temperatures of about 80 –120 degrees centigrade and the atmosphere is very humid keeping the exterior of the brick as moist as possible. This is monitored very closely to reduce surface cracking. The bricks will shrink in the dryers as the clay particles come together and they become strong enough to be stacked, but at this stage they have no weather resistant qualities</p>
                                    <p>Drying schedules vary but between 18 to 40 hours is typical for an automated plant. Special shapes and large units can take up to a week or more. The dry bricks are then set onto kiln cars ready to be fired.</p>

                                    <p class="subtitle">Firing</p>
                                    <p>Firing temperatures vary considerably between different clay types and are often quite critical. During firing, bricks undergo a physical change. Clay particles and impurities are fused together to produce a hard durable and weather resistant product. This is called vitrification. This is usually accompanied by further shrinkage and a colour change. Temperatures vary greatly depending on clay type but are generally in the range of 900 – 1200 degrees centigrade. Obviously bricks cannot suddenly be subjected to these temperatures so firing is in three stages:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Pre heating – this ensures total dryness of the brick and utilises combustion gasses in the
kiln to raise the brick temperature. (Where wet setting has taken place great care needs to be taken at this stage)</li>
                                        <li>Firing – Fuel (Sawdust) is used to raise and maintain the temperature to the required level over a few hours.</li>
                                        <li>Cooling – Cold air is drawn into the kiln to cool the bricks slowly ready for sorting and
packing. This air becomes hot and is drawn off and recycled for use in the drying process.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p class="subtitle">Tunnel kiln</p>
                                    <p>In a tunnel kiln dry bricks are loaded onto a fireproof trolley or kiln car. This then travels very slowly through the kiln. Typical schedule through the kiln from end to end is 3-4 days but variations occur depending on production schedules.</p>
                                    <p>Although tunnel kilns are generally more expensive to build than chamber kilns they are more economical to run and lend themselves to high degrees of automatic control. It is essential that tunnel kilns are run on a continuous basis for ideally several years at a time between shutdowns.<p>
                                    <p>Different firing schedules are necessary for different clay types. This is not just a matter of peak temperature. To maximise production it is clearly necessary to arrange for long production runs and as few changes as possible in order to achieve best results.</p>

                                    <p class="subtitle">Selection &amp; Packaging</p>
                                    <p>Following firing, bricks are selected and packaged. This may be by a manual method or by machine. Mechanised packing is limited to regular production types where all bricks are of the same size and shape. Special shapes are packed manually. Packing machines present bricks to the inspectors who remove any substandard product leaving the best quality to be banded together in packs of 407 (blocks) and 600 (solid bricks).</p>
